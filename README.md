# Forecasting Open-Weight AI Model Growth on Hugging Face

## Abstract
 As the open-weight AI landscape continues to proliferateâ€”with model development, significant investment, and user interestâ€”it becomes increasingly important to predict which models will ultimately drive innovation and shape AI ecosystems. Building on parallels with citation dynamics in scientific literature, we propose a framework to quantify how an open-weight modelâ€™s influence evolves. Specifically, we adapt the model introduced by Wang et al. for scientific citations, using three key parametersâ€”immediacy, longevity, and relative fitnessâ€”to track the cumulative number of fine-tuned models of an open-weight model. Our findings reveal that this citation-style approach can effectively capture the diverse trajectories of open-weight model adoption, with most models fitting well and outliers indicating unique patterns or abrupt jumps in usage.
